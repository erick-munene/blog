 ##Turing Phone
 The Turing Phone is built with a pioneering material called Liquidmorphium™, an amorphous “liquid metal” alloy tougher than either titanium or steel - so what’s in your hand is as strong as your privacy protection.
It has currently dropped from Android OS to a linux based OS Sailfish.
It offers end to end encryption making it more secure than the famous Blackberry.

* Specifications
The Turing is also fully waterproof thanks to a nanocoating that shields its internal components. It can survive dunks in the pool and most submersions without issue. Those internals aren't top of the line, however; the Turing is powered by an aging 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 chip and features a 5.5-inch, 1080p display that falls short of today's big-brand flagships in terms of sharpness. But Turing Robotics isn't Samsung, and in fairness the screen looked fine.

Around back is a  13 MP HDR with Dual Flash primary camera and 8 MP HDR secondary camera, non-removable 3,000mAh battery and integrated NFC chip. But in yet another far out, strange idea, the phone comes with a built-in cryptocurrency called Turing coin. Chao says the device could appreciate in value if it somehow catches on. That sounds like a dream, which is maybe something you can say about this entire project. Is anyone actually going to buy this thing?
the phone comes with DDR3 3GB RAM
EMMC 16GB/64GB/128GB storage
